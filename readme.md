# WDI Project 1: Match Mania

--

### Game Overview:

Match Mania is a game in which a player must race against the clock to uncover matched items from the game board. Player(s) will have 60 seconds to uncover as many matches as they can. Bonus points awarded to players that uncover all possible matches before time expires. 

### Rules:

- Each player will have 30 seconds to uncover matches
- Either the player to uncover all matches in the shortest amount of time, or the player to uncover the most matches will win the game
- Players will lose 10 points if they trigger the hidden bomb
- Players will be awarded 5 bonus points for uncovering all matches before time expires 
- If both players happen to uncover the same amount of matches or uncover all matches in the same amount of time, that game will result in a 'Draw' (or think of a cool tiebreaker game)

### Categories: 
##### Sports -
The sports category will require players to uncover matches relating to the world of sports. For example: If a player uncovers two baseballs in a row, that will result in a match. 

##### Food - 
Everyone's favorite category. The Food category requires players to uncover food-related matches. Example: Uncovering two pizzas in a row will result in a match! 

##### Numbers - 
For those mathematicians out there. Players must uncovere matching numbers in order to get credit for matches. 

##### Colors - 
Self-explanatory. Uncover two of the same color to get credit with a match!
