# WDI Project 1: Match Mania

--

### Game Overview:

Match Mania is a game in which a player must race against the clock to uncover matched items from the game board. Player(s) will have 60 seconds to uncover as many matches as they can. Hint: Matches = good, bombs = bad!

### Approach Taken: 
I started out wanting to create a simple memory game with some more depth and functionality than past projects. I started out by building a very basic memory/matching game for a single player. Once the basic format of the game was complete, I added two player functionality to the game. From there, I decided to go in and add some bonus features to my game by adding the hidden bombs, adding a timer for each player's turn, and adding a number of categories for the user to choose from.

### Rules:

- Players will earn 10 points for every match they uncover. 
- Players will lose points if they uncover one of three hidden bombs.

### Categories: 
##### Sports -
The sports category will require players to uncover matches relating to the world of sports. For example: If a player uncovers two baseballs in a row, that will result in a match. 

##### Food - 
Everyone's favorite category. The Food category requires players to uncover food-related matches. Example: Uncovering two pizzas in a row will result in a match! 

##### Animals - 
Match up two of the same animal to earn points!

##### Colors - 
Self-explanatory. Uncover two of the same color to get credit with a match!

##### Miscelaneous - 
A group of random items hidden throughout. Match two of the same item and earn some points!

### Unsolved Problems - 
- Known bug where if two bombs are matches, player receives the 10 points for a match
- Adjust game design for a better user experience
- Need to make the game instructions more clear
- Need to add more content to each category so there are less empty boxes
